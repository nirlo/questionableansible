# QuestionableAnsible

## Summary

Questionable Ansible is a Ansible playbook generator for google cloud instances. It provides a front end interface for getting infrastructure up and running quickly and efficiently. Once you have your google cloud authentication information, you can connect to build as many servers as you need.

Need to build your Kubernetes cluster on GCP, input the information that you want and we'll do the hard work. 

Have to set up services on all of your servers and don't want to fight with configuration files? we take the base configuration files and take your choices and build from there and let you know what has happened in the background.
